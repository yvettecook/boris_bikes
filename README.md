#Boris Bikes
--------

## Description
A simple Ruby system for managing Boris Bikes in London.


## Context

Week 1 project at Makers Academy


## Spec

A simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. It will:
* keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. 
* allow you to rent the bikes and return them.
* occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental.
* have a garage to fix the bikes 
* a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.

## Collaborators

This week [Camilla](https://github.com/camillavk) and I paired on building this. We used her laptop, so most commits are not from my account.


## Tools

Planned using **CRC cards** and a lot of roundabout discussion.

Built using:
* Ruby
* RSpec 
* Command Line
* Github
